# Project Overview

This is an Android application for reading Tipitaka. It has a lot of tools to help reader easily learn the Tipitaka such as Pali-Thai dictionary, Tipitaka comparing, Highlight important text, etc. The application is written in Java/Kotlin. 

## Context Navigation (Graphify)

### 3-Layer Query Rule
1. **First:** query `graphify-out/graph.json` or `graphify-out/wiki/index.md`
   to understand code structure and connections
2. **Second:** query the Obsidian vault for decisions, progress, and project context
3. **Third:** only read raw code files when editing
   or when the first two layers don't have the answer

### When to rebuild the graph
- After structural changes (new modules, major refactors)
- Command: `graphify . --update` (only processes modified files)
- The graph is persistent — NO need to rebuild every session

### Do NOT
- Don't manually modify files inside `graphify-out/`
- Don't re-read the entire codebase if the graph already has the information
